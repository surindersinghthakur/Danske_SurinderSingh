Main API Endoint https://localhost:44367/api

Technologies used:
-- .NetCore 3.0
-- SQL Server 2014 or higher
-- ORM: Dapper (Free nuget package)
-- xUnit
-- Postman -- For API endpoint testing
-- Dbup - Tried it but I got conflict with package and does not look relevant for this task as it is test task.
      -- tried to use to highlight that we can use this package for auto db upgrades.


What is Done:
-- Add, Edit, List, Get by add endpoints for Municipality and Tax Scheduling
-- Get Tax Rate for any municipality for any date
-- Tests -- Postman tests and XUnit (have added only 1 test there, as it is already there on postman)
-- DI (Default from .NetCore, have not used Unity or any other container)
-- Documentation on Interface methods itself


What is not done:
 -- Authentication/Authorization -- I have used mostly Auth0 for that, have not tried here, however have kept code in startup.cs
 -- XUnit full tests - have written one to demonstrate that I am aware of that
 -- Mocking -- have not mocked Db objects in test
 -- Picking validation messages from resource or appsettings/app.config
 

Setup:
-- Create new empty database
-- Run script file from DbUp -> Scripts -> CreateSchema.sql
-- Update connection string in "appsettings.json" or we can add in User Secrets file
-- Run below Postman tests, replace endpoint if different:
   All endpoints are available in Postman with samples and TESTS as well, below is link:

Explain the logic in the readme file
     -- Get tax rate for particular municipality for a specific date
		     Checks if daily rate is available for passed date and municipality
         If not then checks for weekly, if not then checks monthly and lastly checks yearly
